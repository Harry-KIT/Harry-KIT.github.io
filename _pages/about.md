I am a Research Scientist and Head of AI at Bending Spoons in Milan. Before flying back home, I spent a year in the On-Device AI team, at Facebook Reality Labs. Prior to joining Facebook, I had the privilege to be part of the Creative Intelligence Lab, at Adobe Research. I spent eight memorable years as Intern, PhD and Post-Doctoral Researcher at Disney Research Zurich, in the Imaging and Video Processing Group. I obtained my PhD in 2017 from ETHZ. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Graphics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
