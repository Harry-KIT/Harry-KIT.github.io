			<p>This research project is dedicated to the development of an advanced visual inspection system tailored for the detection of polyps 
				during colonoscopy procedures. The study encompasses key elements of image preprocessing, cutting-edge computer vision techniques, 
				and precise object detection and segmentation methods. By integrating these technologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency 
				of polyp identification, contributing to early diagnosis and improved medical outcomes in gastrointestinal health.</p>"

	<b>Yolact</b> (You only look at the coefficients) which is a more optimized version for instance segmentation, which has secured a good reputation for its speed and accuracy trade-offs. It is able to achieve 29.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on MS COCO at 33 frames per second, much faster than the other competitive frameworks.

<p>
	YOLACT uses ResNet-101 with FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks)that helps in creating pyramids of feature maps of high-resolution images rather than the conventional Pyramid of images approach, therefore reducing the time and requirements of computational capabilities. In addition, Yolact is suitable for "real time" applications.

	<b>The brief description of our experiment:</b>
</p>

<p>
	Colorectal cancer from the appearance of polyps that can be malignant is one of the most fatal diseases in the world. To find these polyps in patients, colonoscopy is performed, which is a very efficient technique in this case. Clinically, detecting and segmenting these polyps in order to determine their presence or not is a very difficult process that requires a lot of time and experience from professionals, depending directly on these factors. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to have an automatic, effective and reliable method of detecting and segmenting these polyps, making diagnoses faster and more accurate.
</p>

<p>
	In order to assist in the development of a method, we also used Yolact for downstream task like polyp segmentation. The pre-trained model can be applicable for polyp video datasets.
