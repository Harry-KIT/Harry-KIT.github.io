title: "A Visual Inspection System Research Designed for Detecting Polyps in Colonoscopy Procedure"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/polyp-example_77.jpg'> <br/><br/>
			This research project is dedicated to the development of an advanced visual inspection system tailored for the detection of polyps 
				during colonoscopy procedures. The study encompasses key elements of image preprocessing, cutting-edge computer vision techniques, 
				and precise object detection and segmentation methods. By integrating these technologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency 
				of polyp identification, contributing to early diagnosis and improved medical outcomes in gastrointestinal health."
