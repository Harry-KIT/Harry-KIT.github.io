title: "A Research Applied to Effective Feature Extraction using Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Polyps in Colonoscopy Video Footages"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/SSL_GAN_model_fin.jpg'> <br/> <br/>
			This research is dedicated to the advancement of polyp detection in colonoscopy video footage through the application of self-supervised learning techniques, 
			including the Vision Transformer (DINO), Generative Adversarial Network (StyleGAN2-ADA), and transfer-learning methods. While U-Net, ResUNet, and ResUNet++ 
			were used for evaluation, the primary focus remains on enhancing feature extraction. By harnessing the power of these innovative technologies, we aim to 
			improve the accuracy and efficiency of polyp detection, contributing to early diagnosis and enhanced patient care in gastrointestinal health "
