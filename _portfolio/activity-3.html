	<b>Purpose:</b> Deep learning-based applications are commonly used in the medical sphere, especially image classification; thus, deep learning has great potential to impact image-based specialties such as radiology. Deep learning may have the potential to address existing issues in sinus radiography. Because an imbalanced dataset causes problems in radiographic classification performance, generative adversarial network (GAN) usage is proposed to improve deep learning performance by generating part of the insufficient data. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of supervised learning using GANs for Waters’ view radiographs.

<p>
	<b>Approach:</b> Three specialists assessed images of Waters’ view radiographs and categorized them into four classes to prepare input datasets. Subsequently, the diagnosed images were resized to 1024 × 1024 pixels through image processing. Next, GANs were used to provide sufficient images for each class. GAN implementations were performed twice sequentially to prepare a large amount of valuable synthetic data. An estimation for the performance of supervised learning models with imbalanced and balanced datasets were demonstrated.

	<b>Results:</b> Without synthetic data, the diagnostic performance of supervised learning models was insignificant because of an imbalanced dataset. After a radiologic technologist deleted awkward images from the generated images, we observed a diagnostic improvement to 82% accuracy with the first balanced dataset for each class and 91% accuracy with the second balanced dataset of generated images.

	<b>Conclusions:</b> We expect that as the number of datasets with generated images using GANs increases, the supervised learning performance for diagnosing maxillary sinusitis on Waters’ view radiographs will improve.
