			<p>
				This research is dedicated to the advancement of polyp detection in colonoscopy video footage through the application of self-supervised learning techniques, 
				including the Vision Transformer (DINO), Generative Adversarial Network (StyleGAN2-ADA), and transfer-learning methods. While U-Net, ResUNet, and ResUNet++ 
				were used for evaluation, the primary focus remains on enhancing feature extraction. By harnessing the power of these innovative technologies, we aim to 
				improve the accuracy and efficiency of polyp detection, contributing to early diagnosis and enhanced patient care in gastrointestinal health.

	Deep learning has brought significant developments in image understanding tasks such as object detection, image classification, and image segmentation. But the success of image recognition largely relies on supervised learning that requires huge number of human-annotated labels. To avoid costly collection of labeled data and the domains where very few standard pre-trained models exist,  
	<b>Self-Supervised learning (SSL)</b>  comes to our rescue. Self-supervised learning is a form of unsupervised learning that allows the network to learn rich visual features that help in performing downstream computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

	<b>The brief description of our experiment:</b>
</p>
<p>
	This work deals with the problem of polyp detection without labeled dataset in medical domain. SSL, GAN and Transfer-learning are quickly advancing fields. Our underlying insight is that leveraging those approaches together brings benefit. By the strategy of unifying these three approaches, we propose the integrated model and use it derive polyps detection with no annotated dataset.

	In <b>conclusions</b>, Self-supervised methods have shown results at power with supervised learning by leveraging the huge amount of unlabeled data. The effectiveness of self-supervised
	learning techniques has been found in complex downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation, etc. The unlabeled data can be utilized and present in abundance 
	for building effective pre-trained models.
