title: "Sinusitis diagnosis X-ray image generation using GAN"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/PGAN_over_PNS_3.jpg'> <br/><br/> 
			Our project focused on addressing the limitations of real medical image data by creating a synthetic dataset. 
			We collected and purified PNS data from medical institutions, using it to train state-of-the-art GANs,
			including StylGAN2-ADA, ProGAN, and Hybrid Diffusion-GAN models, to create  realistic medical images.
			The goal was to enhance accessibility for researchers and practitioners, providing them 
			with a valuable resource for their work. This project exemplifies our dedication to overcoming data 
			constraints and promoting innovation in healthcare and AI."
